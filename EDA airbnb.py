# ### The following columns have null values:host_name, last_review, reviews_per_month, license. The last_review column is a date column, so the most likely solution for it is to drop it. The reviews_per_month column is required to find trends between data, so it is best to append missing values in 0. The license column will be dropped as well.

# ###### we know the most host renter who is490705947 and the lowest one in top 15 is 3977485597

# Conclusion:
# 1-When prices were analysed across different neighbourhoods and neighbourhood_gps, a considerable range was found. Amandus - Atheneum was the most expensive and polder was the cheapest
# 2-the top 10 most reviewed listings are mostly private rooms that are either in Amandus - Atheneum	 or Borgerhout Extra Muros	 with at least a â˜…4.41 rating. The average price per night among these is $50 which is a price of average density among the neighbourhood.

# ##### This EDA helps us to learn about:
# 1) The occurrence of prices
# 
# 2) How to save company resources and costs by knowing which locations and prices to make more available
# 
# 3) How to price newly introduced rooms
# 
# 4) This is also helpful to understand analytics better and how to offer better deals to potential cutomers
